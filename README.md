# NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::Static::File - Serve a specific static file

# SYNOPSIS

In your Catalyst class:

```perl
use Catalyst qw/
    Static::File
  /;
```

In a controller method:

```
$c->serve_static_file( $absolute_path, $type );
```

# DESCRIPTION

This plugin provides a simple method for your [Catalyst](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst) app to send a specific static file.

Unlike [Catalyst::Plugin::Static::Simple](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst%3A%3APlugin%3A%3AStatic%3A%3ASimple),

- It only supports serving a single file, not a directory of static files. Use [Plack::Middleware::Static](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack%3A%3AMiddleware%3A%3AStatic) if you want to
serve multiple files.
- It assumes that you know what you're doing. If the file does not exist, it will throw an fatal error.
- It uses [Plack::MIME](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack%3A%3AMIME) to identify the content type, but you can override that.
- It adds a file path to the file handle, and plays nicely with [Plack::Middleware::XSendfile](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack%3A%3AMiddleware%3A%3AXSendfile) and [Plack::Middleware::ETag](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack%3A%3AMiddleware%3A%3AETag).
- It does not log anything.
